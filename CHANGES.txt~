v<0.1.26>, <01.09.2015> -- Changes list: 

Major changes completed!

1. 00_setup.py script functions to build the initial file structure correctly.
2. Bugs with 01_database_init.py script have been worked out and for now it's creating the SQL 
databases correctly. 
3. Issues with psprepocess.py script have been resolved.
4. XCORR calculations are no longer yielding incorrect results as a result of improper initialisation of self.dataarray, self.phase_stack and self.pws variables in the Crosscorrelation class in pscrosscorr.py in seissuite.ant
5. Creation of SNR list with time. This will give the user the opportunity to see how quickly or slowly the processing methods they have chosen are coverging or 
6. Other things that I've likely forgotten. This application is still incredibly new and I'm currently running through as many examples and tests that I can think of. Flailing about like a headless chicken!
